Purpose of Time Tracker website:

The purpose of TimeTracer is to allow students to create an account where they can add 
multiple courses and start a timer for a particular assignment or for a study session. 

This will allow students to view the time spent on an assignment, or the amount they 
have spent studying for a course, or view when they get the most studying hours in 
during the day. 

Over time this will be of value to students to view their efforts per course/assignment 
and see where they could adjust their study habits.
