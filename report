1. Tasks Assigned to Team Mates:

Shruti:Course Pages html and css
Sarah: Signup page, login page html and css
Shahbaz: Home Page html and css

2. We discussed in the meeting that everyone should complete their work atleast 12 hrs prior to the final submission so that work of each teammates can be reviewed and the links can be properly checked, in case if there's any need of edit the pages, that can be done before the final submission.
